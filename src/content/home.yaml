heading: About Me
text: I began my journey 17 years ago as a junior front-end engineer for a small design company building ColdFusion websites for construction companies. A lot has changed since then. I've experienced front end devlopment grow from simple static HTML websites into complex API-driven JavaScript applications. Today, I lead the front-end efforts for an international law firm, working with technologies such as React, Redux, Jest, Rect Testing Library, and SharePoint.
